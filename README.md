## **An add-on for [<span style="color:#ff80c0;">Heartstone</span>](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/heartstone).**

---


### Adds the **<span style="color:#ff80c0;">Amulet of Connection</span>**, an item that comes in pairs and allows you to teleport to the player whom you've given the second amulet.

---

To craft the Amulet you need to combine 2 Heartstones and a Totem of Undying, after which you can fill it with Ender Pearls then use it to teleport!

The cost of Ender Pearls to teleport scales with distance:

- 0 - 999 Blocks: 1 Pearl
- 1000 - 9,999: 2 Pearls
- 10,000+: 3 Pearls

If you need to link 2 Amulets with different ID numbers - combine them in a crafting table
